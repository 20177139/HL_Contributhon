In computing, a cache (/kæʃ/ (About this soundlisten) kash,[1] or /ˈkeɪʃ/ kaysh in AuE[2]) is a hardware or software component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster; the data stored in a cache might be the result of an earlier computation or a copy of data stored elsewhere.
